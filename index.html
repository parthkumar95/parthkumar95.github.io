<p> I am a Physics PhD candidate the University of Arizona working on Nonequilibrium Quantum Dynamics.</p>
<p> More specifically, the core of my doctoral work addresses the question of how to partition the energy and entropy of time-dependent open quantum systems in a thermodynamically consistent manner--a problem which has attracted much debate and discussion in recent years. </p>
<p> I am advised by Prof. Charles A. Stafford.</p>
