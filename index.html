<p> I am a Physics PhD candidate at the University of Arizona working on Nonequilibrium Quantum Dynamics, expecting to graduate in Spring 2024. I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions broadly in the field of Open Quantum Systems theory.</p>
<p> The core of my doctoral work addresses the question of how to partition the energy and entropy of time-dependent open quantum systems in a thermodynamically consistent manner--a problem which has attracted much debate and discussion in recent years. Additionally, I have worked on quantum information engines, topological effects and fluctuation theorems in open quantum systems during the course of my research. </p>
<p> I am advised by Prof. Charles A. Stafford.</p>
